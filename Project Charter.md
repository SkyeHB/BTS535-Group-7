# Note Sharing App

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to develop a collaborative note-taking and list-sharing web application. The app will allow users to create personal notes or lists, share them with friends, and collaborate in real time. Users will be able to edit shared notes simultaneously, view updates instantly, and organize their ideas effectively. The goal is to simplify group productivity, brainstorming, and planning tasks through a clean and interactive interface.

**Date:** October 10th, 2025  
**Current Version:** 1.0  
**Project Team:** Skye, Harrison, and Muhammad

## 2. Overview

Muhammad, Skye, and Harrison are planning to build an app designed to help users create notes and/or list and then share them to their friends either to just simply share what they have or they can work on those notes together.

### 2.1 Objective
The objective of this project is to build an easy-to-use web application that supports personal and shared note-taking. Users will be able to:
- Create, edit, and delete notes and to-do lists.
- Share notes with friends for collaboration.
- View and co-edit shared notes in real time.
- Receive update notifications when collaborators make changes.
- Access their notes from any device using secure authentication.

The system will be deployed prior to the end of the Fall semester and tested in both desktop and mobile browsers.

## 3. Milestones
1. Define the technological stack (front-end, back-end, database, and hosting).  
2. Develop core user interface for creating and managing notes/lists.  
3. Implement user authentication and secure login/logout flow.  
4. Enable sharing functionality and collaborative editing features.  
5. Deploy the application to a live server for user testing and feedback collection.
